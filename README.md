# Predicting-Calories-Burnt-A-Machine-Learning-Project
The project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about exercise patterns and corresponding calorie measurements. We will cover various aspects of the project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation
1. Introduction

In today’s health-conscious world, monitoring calorie expenditure has become important for fitness and lifestyle management.

Traditional calorie tracking methods rely on wearables or medical devices, which may be costly or inaccessible to all.

Machine Learning (ML) provides a smart solution to estimate calories burnt based on exercise and body-related features.

This project uses a dataset combining exercise details and calorie measurements to build predictive models.

The overall aim is to design a system that can predict calories burnt accurately and can be integrated into fitness apps, healthcare systems, and personal monitoring tools.

2. Goals of the Project

To merge exercise and calorie datasets for unified analysis.

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for better understanding of feature relationships.

To preprocess the data for machine learning models (encoding, cleaning, splitting).

To train multiple ML regression models and compare their performance.

To evaluate models using statistical error metrics and choose the most accurate one.

To save the best performing model for future deployment in real-time calorie prediction.

3. Data Collection and Integration

Two CSV files were used:

calories.csv → contains calorie measurement values.

exercise.csv → contains features like User_ID, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature.

Both files were merged using User_ID as the common key.

The resulting dataset contained all independent features along with the dependent variable (Calories).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visual Analysis:

Bar plots were drawn for Age, Duration, and Calories grouped by Gender.

Count plot was created to study gender distribution.

Histograms were plotted for Age to analyze its spread.

Scatter plots explored relationships between Calories vs. Duration, Calories vs. Height, and Age vs. Calories.

Box plots visualized Age variation across genders.

Line plots and distribution plots were used to observe trends in Age and Calories.

Statistical Analysis:

Descriptive statistics were generated using .describe().

Summary included mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for all numerical features.

Insights from EDA:

Duration, Age, and Heart Rate had noticeable influence on Calories burnt.

Gender distribution was not perfectly balanced but sufficient for analysis.

5. Data Preprocessing

Encoding: Gender was converted into numerical form (male = 1, female = 0).

Feature Selection:

Dropped User_ID (identifier not useful for prediction).

Defined X (independent features) = Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart Rate, Body Temperature, Gender.

Defined y (dependent variable) = Calories.

Data Splitting: Used train_test_split to divide data into:

80% training data (for model learning).

20% testing data (for unbiased evaluation).

6. Model Training

Implemented multiple regression algorithms:

Linear Regression – simple baseline model.

Ridge Regression – with regularization.

Lasso Regression – feature selection with penalty.

Decision Tree Regressor – non-linear approach.

Random Forest Regressor – ensemble model for accuracy.

Each model was trained on the training dataset (x_train, y_train).

Predictions were made on the test dataset (x_test).

7. Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using two main metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

R² Score: Measures how well the model explains the variance in calories burnt.

Results showed significant differences among models:

Linear and Ridge performed moderately.

Decision Tree captured patterns but risked overfitting.

Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance, giving the highest accuracy and lowest error.

8. Model Selection and Saving

The Random Forest Regressor was chosen as the final model due to its superior performance.

The trained model was saved as rfr.pkl using the Pickle library for deployment and reuse.

Training and testing feature datasets were also exported for reference.

9. Applications

Fitness Applications: Helps users estimate calories burnt without expensive devices.

Healthcare Monitoring: Doctors can use predictions to design diet and exercise plans.

Sports and Athletics: Assists coaches in tracking performance and tailoring workouts.

Wearable Devices: Enhances accuracy of calorie estimation in smartwatches and trackers.

10. Conclusion

The project followed a structured methodology:

Data collection and merging.

Preprocessing and encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis.

Model training and evaluation.

Model selection and saving for future use.

The comparison of models proved that ensemble methods like Random Forest outperform simple regression approaches.

The final model can be integrated into real-world systems to provide personalized calorie predictions, contributing to fitness, healthcare, and lifestyle management
